## Analysis of my favourite YouTube channel for cooking - Food Wishes!

### Introduction

[Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/c/foodwishes) is an YouTube channel with more than 4.16 million subscribers (as of Mar 2022) and it's one of the very first channels that has been around since YouTube was at its baby stage. The channel is owned by Chef [John Mitzewich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mitzewich), who has many years of experience in cooking and is proud of his passion in food. In addition to the plethora of video contents on his YouTube channel, he also publishes a written receipe to accompany each one of his cooking videos, which can be found on [his blog](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/).<p></br></p>

### Purpose of analysis

With so many titles John has published on his channel, I'm interested in the data relating to his videos published in the last decade (*i.e.*, from year 2012 to 2022). I'll be doing the following analyses:

1. Year-wise video stats, including title counts, play counts, like counts, and comment counts
2. When (which day)
3. How many times 
4. The top 30% videos in terms of likes and plays: what are the keywords? how long are these videos
5.
